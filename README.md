# Brew-Sales-Dashboard-Analysis

This dashboard offers a complete perspective of coffee sales growth by country. Key analytics include total sales, sales by person, and sales by country, which are studied with order date, roast type, and loyalty card utilization.

Key Findings:

Total Sales Trend: The line graph shows a shifting sales pattern throughout the quarter, with distinct peaks and falls indicating potential promotional efforts or seasonal fluctuations. Further analysis is required to link these swings to specific marketing initiatives or external sources.

Sales per person: The bar chart shows individual sales performance, indicating top performers and areas for development. This information can be utilized to develop tailored training and reward programs.

Sales by Country: The 3D bar chart vividly shows sales distribution across countries. The United States leads sales, followed by Ireland and the United Kingdom. This regional knowledge enables effective resource allocation and tailored marketing initiatives in high-performing locations.

Filter Functionality: The interactive filters for "Order Date," "Roast Type Name," "Loyalty Card," and "Country" provide detailed analysis, allowing stakeholders to dive down into specific segments and spot trends across specific demographics or product categories. For example, filtering by "Medium" roast and "Loyalty Card" members can give useful information about this client segment's preferences.

This dashboard offers useful information for maximizing targeted marketing campaigns, resource allocation, and sales tactics.  A deeper comprehension of market dynamics and the ability to make better business decisions can be obtained through additional analysis, including correlation with external data sources.  #dashboard #salesanalysis #businessintelligence #excel #coffeesales
